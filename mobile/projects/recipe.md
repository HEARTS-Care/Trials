# 🍲 Recipe App Development Requirements Document

---

## 📝 Description

Develop a mobile application that provides users with a comprehensive experience for browsing and managing recipes. The application should facilitate discovery, detailed viewing, and personalized user interaction.

---

## 🌟 Core Features

- **🖼️ Splash Screen:**  
  An initial loading screen displayed upon application launch.

- **🔐 User Authentication:**
  - **🆕 Registration:** Allow new users to create an account.
  - **🔑 Login:** Enable existing users to sign in.
  - **💾 Local Persistence:** User authentication status and basic profile data should be stored locally (mock backend).

- **📋 Recipe Listing:**
  - Display a dynamic list of available recipes, including their names and a thumbnail image.
  - **🔎 Filtering:** Provide functionality to filter the recipe list by various cuisine types (e.g., Italian, Ethiopian, Indian).

- **📖 Recipe Detail View:**
  - Upon selecting a recipe from the list, navigate to a dedicated screen displaying comprehensive details.
  - Details should include: full recipe name, a larger image, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

- **👤 User Profile Page:**
  - A dedicated screen for logged-in users to view their basic profile information (e.g., username, email).
  - _(Future consideration: ability to edit profile details or view saved/favorite recipes)._

- **🧭 Navigation System:**
  - **⬇️ Bottom Navigation Bar:** Implement a primary navigation component at the bottom of the screen for quick access to key sections (e.g., Recipe List, Profile).
  - **📂 Drawer Navigation:** Include a side drawer for secondary navigation options or additional features (e.g., Settings, About, Logout).

## 🛠️ Skills Tested

This project is designed to assess proficiency in modern mobile application development practices, specifically focusing on:

- **⚡ Dynamic List Rendering:** Efficiently displaying and updating large datasets in a scrollable format.
- **🧩 Advanced Navigation Patterns:** Implementing complex navigation flows including initial splash-based routing, tab-based navigation, and drawer-based navigation.
- **🔄 Robust State Management:** Managing application-wide and feature-specific states, including reactive updates to the UI.
- **💽 Local Data Persistence:** Storing and retrieving application data locally to simulate backend interactions for authentication and user profiles.
- **📝 User Input and Form Handling:** Securely capturing and validating user input for authentication.
- **🧱 Modular UI Design:** Structuring user interfaces with reusable components and clear separation of concerns.
- **❗ Error Handling and User Feedback:** Providing appropriate feedback to the user during asynchronous operations (e.g., login failures).

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

The application should adhere to a clean architecture pattern, leveraging the **GetX** framework for core functionalities.

- **📦 Models:**  
  Define the data structures for application entities (e.g., Recipe, User). These models should support serialization/deserialization for local persistence.

- **🗄️ Data Layer:**  
  Responsible for providing data. This will primarily involve a mock data source for recipes and GetStorage for user authentication and profile data, simulating a backend.

- **🎛️ Controllers (GetxController):**  
  Encapsulate the business logic and manage the state for specific features (e.g., AuthController, RecipeController, SplashController). They should expose observable (Rx) variables for UI reactivity.

- **🔗 Bindings (Bindings):**  
  Used for dependency injection, ensuring that controllers are correctly instantiated and available to their respective views.

- **🖥️ Views (Screens/Widgets):**  
  The UI components that consume data from controllers and dispatch user actions. They should be reactive to changes in controller state.

- **🛣️ Routing:**  
  Utilize GetX's powerful routing system for declarative and imperative navigation between screens.
